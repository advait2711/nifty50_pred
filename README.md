# Nifty 50 Indices Linear Regression

This repository contains a linear regression model built from scratch to predict the Nifty 50 indices from 2001 to 2021. The model was implemented using gradient descent and mathematical equations, providing a hands-on understanding of the underlying mechanics of linear regression.


## Model Details

The linear regression model was implemented from scratch with the following characteristics:

- **Gradient Descent:** Custom implementation using mathematical equations for optimization.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 59.88
- **R-squared (RÂ²):** 0.99

These metrics indicate the model's performance, with the R-squared value showing a high degree of correlation between the predicted and actual values.
